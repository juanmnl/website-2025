                <h2>My Journey into Design</h2>

                <p>
                  Hi, I'm Juan. I design digital products, from strategy to
                  production, with a focus on complex systems and human-centered
                  principles. Product, UX, UI, Interaction... call it what you
                  will, I just call it DESIGN.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My design journey began in the early 2000s and has evolved
                  through every major shift in digital design. Flash, Photoshop,
                  Fireworks, HTML/CSS, IE-specific-stylesheets, jQuery,
                  mobile-first, responsive design, design systems, Figma... I've
                  seen and adapted to it all. Today, I work at the intersection
                  of complex systems and human needs: enterprise tools,
                  industrial, machine-learning interfaces, and human rights
                  technology. Through it all, my principles remain constant:
                  making powerful tools simple, humane, and usable. (And yes,
                  beautiful, because beauty matters).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Until August 2025, I lead design at
                  <a href="https://www.huridocs.org" target="_blank">HURIDOCS</a
                  >, a human rights organization where I helped HHRR defenders
                  structure, manage, and preserve critical legal evidence.
                  Whether it's modernizing the Uwazi platform used by 150+
                  organizations, designing secure tools for fieldwork, or making
                  machine learning accessible to non-technical users, my work
                  directly impacted those fighting for justice worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Beyond human rights tech, I've designed enterprise software
                  for Fortune 500 companies across logistics, fintech, and
                  healthcare. I thrive on solving messy problems with sharp
                  constraints, the kind where user needs, technical limitations,
                  and business goals create fascinating design challenges.
                </p>

                <p>

                    ><strong
                      >Based in Quito, Ecuador. Working globally. Fluent in
                      Spanish, English and French.</strong
                    ></span
                  >
                </p>

                <h2>How I Work</h2>

                <p>
                  I'm hands-on and collaborative, working best in small,
                  mission-driven teams where research, prototyping, and
                  iteration drive decisions. I care equally about front-end
                  feasibility, stakeholder alignment, and user experience,
                  because great design happens when all three align.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While tools evolve, good design is rooted in clarity, empathy,
                  and relevance. I bring both strategic thinking and practical
                  execution to every project.
                </p>

                <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>

                <p>
                  When I'm not designing, you'll find me exploring with my
                  camera, getting lost in Latin American literature, or writing
                  about my experiences in this world. These pursuits aren't just
                  hobbies, photography sharpens my eye for composition, reading
                  deepens my empathy for different perspectives, and writing
                  clarifies my thinking about complex problems.
                </p>

                <h2>Let's Connect</h2>

                <p>
                  I'm always interested in connecting with fellow designers,
                  discussing new opportunities, or exploring how design can
                  drive meaningful impact. Whether you need someone to tackle
                  complex enterprise UX, lead design for mission-driven
                  products, or bring clarity to ambitious technical projects,
                  let's talk.
