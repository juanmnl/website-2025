              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                Human rights organizations needed to process thousands of
                documents for evidence extraction, but machine learning tools
                were too complex and technical for non-technical users to
                operate effectively. Organizations were drowning in
                documentation—legal briefs, witness testimonies, government
                reports, and media coverage—but lacked the technical resources
                to leverage AI for systematic information extraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                The existing approach required either hiring expensive technical
                specialists or manually reading through every document, creating
                an impossible bottleneck for organizations working on
                time-sensitive human rights cases. The challenge was designing
                an interface that made sophisticated AI capabilities accessible
                to domain experts without technical backgrounds, while
                maintaining the precision and reliability that human rights work
                demands.

              <h3>Process & Research</h3>
              <p>
                We approached this project by building on our existing deep
                knowledge of how human rights organizations use Uwazi. Rather
                than extensive field research, I focused on understanding the
                specific technical and workflow challenges of integrating
                machine learning into established documentation processes.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Internal User Data Analysis:</strong> Leveraged
                  existing usage patterns and feedback from Uwazi's user base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Technical Feasibility Study:</strong> Worked closely
                  with ML engineers to understand AI capabilities and
                  constraints.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Studied existing AI
                  tools and document processing platforms to identify usability
                  gaps.
                </li>
                <li>

                  workflows.

              <p>
                Based on our existing understanding of Uwazi users and
                competitive research insights, I designed experimental workflows
                that transformed machine learning from a black box into a
                collaborative partner. The approach was highly iterative, with
                each design building incrementally on user feedback and
                technical learnings.

                  creating and managing extraction workflows.
                </li>
                <li>

                The testing approach was inherently experimental and
                incremental, leveraging Uwazi's existing user base for rapid
                feedback cycles. Rather than formal usability testing, we
                deployed features gradually to gather real-world usage data and
                iterate based on actual organizational needs.

              <h3>The Solution & Impact</h3>
              <p>
                The implemented system transformed how human rights
                organizations approach large-scale document analysis. Users
                without technical backgrounds successfully trained AI models to
                extract relevant information from their specific document types,
                dramatically reducing the time required for evidence gathering
                while maintaining accuracy standards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The foundation we built enables more sophisticated AI
                capabilities while maintaining the accessible interface
                paradigm. The system now supports organizations in handling
                larger case loads and finding evidence more systematically than
                ever before.

              <h3>Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
              <p>
                This project demonstrated that successful AI democratization
                requires designing for domain expertise rather than technical
                proficiency. I learned that users' mental models of AI
                capabilities significantly impact their trust and effective use
                of machine learning tools.
              </p>

                <li>
                  Automated document classification and routing based on content
                  type
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integration with external legal and news databases for
                  comprehensive case building

              <p>
                This project reinforced that the most powerful AI tools are
                those that amplify human expertise rather than replace it,
                requiring interface design that makes sophisticated technology
                feel like a natural extension of existing professional
                workflows.
