          <h1>Katoen Natie: Railcar Management Automation System</h1>
          <p class="project-intro">
            Designed and implemented a comprehensive automation system that
            transformed manual, paper-based railcar operations into a fully
            digital workflow for petrochemical waste processing. Created a
            dual-platform solution with mobile apps for field personnel and
            desktop applications for managers, orchestrating the coordination of
            railcars, machinery, silos, and human resources across complex
            industrial operations for one of the world's leading logistics
            companies.

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Katoen Natie, a global logistics leader operating across 36
              countries with specialized expertise in petrochemical operations,
              was managing complex railcar operations through entirely manual,
              paper-based processes. Field personnel tracked railcar movements,
              machinery status, and silo operations using clipboards and radio
              communication, while managers relied on phone calls and paper
              reports to coordinate resources and scheduling.
            </p>

            <p>
              This manual system created significant operational inefficiencies
              and safety risks in handling hazardous petrochemical materials.
              Critical information was lost in translation between shifts,
              equipment status was often outdated, and the lack of real-time
              visibility made it impossible to optimize operations or respond
              quickly to changing conditions. The paper-based approach also made
              compliance tracking and audit trails extremely difficult in an
              industry where documentation is crucial for safety and regulatory
              requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              The complexity of coordinating multiple railcars, various
              processing machinery, different silo capacities, and human
              resources across 24/7 operations demanded a sophisticated digital
              solution that could handle the industrial environment's harsh
              conditions while maintaining the reliability that safety-critical
              operations require.

            <h3>Process & Research</h3>
            <p>
              We began with extensive field research, spending time at Katoen
              Natie's petrochemical facilities to understand the complex
              ecosystem of railcar operations. This immersive approach was
              crucial for grasping the nuanced workflows, safety protocols, and
              environmental constraints that would shape the digital solution.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Field Observations:</strong> Shadowed operators,
                supervisors, and managers during different shifts to understand
                current workflows.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Conducted sessions with
                field personnel, managers, safety officers, and administrative
                staff.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Process Mapping:</strong> Documented end-to-end
                workflows from railcar arrival to waste processing completion.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Field personnel needed hands-free, weather-resistant interfaces
                for outdoor industrial environments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Managers required comprehensive oversight tools for resource
                allocation and scheduling optimization.
              </li>
              <li>
                Real-time status updates were critical for preventing
                bottlenecks and safety incidents.
              </li>
              <li>
                The system needed to work reliably in areas with poor
                connectivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integration with existing industrial equipment and sensors was
                essential for automation.

            <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
            <p>
              The testing phase required unique approaches suited to industrial
              environments and safety-critical operations. Rather than
              traditional usability labs, we conducted extensive field testing
              during actual operations, with careful attention to safety
              protocols and minimal disruption to ongoing work.
            </p>

            <h4>Field Testing Approach:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pilot deployment with select operators during controlled
                conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gradual rollout across different shifts to test 24/7 operational
                scenarios.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integration testing with existing machinery and sensor systems.
              </li>
              <li>Stress testing during peak operational periods.</li>
              <li>Safety scenario validation with emergency response teams.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Iterations focused heavily on interface robustness, data accuracy,
              and system reliability. We discovered that industrial environments
              demanded different interaction patterns than typical enterprise
              software, leading to innovative solutions for harsh-condition
              usability.

              The iterative process also revealed the importance of continuous
              feedback loops with field personnel. Their insights were
              invaluable for refining workflows, enhancing safety features, and
              ensuring the system met real-world operational needs.

            <h3>The Solution & Impact</h3>
            <p>
              The implemented system transformed Katoen Natie's railcar

            <h3>Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
              This project highlighted the unique challenges of designing for
              industrial environments where safety, reliability, and
              environmental constraints significantly impact user experience
              decisions. I learned that successful industrial software requires
              deep understanding of operational contexts that can't be
              replicated in traditional design environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The modular system architecture we established enables expansion
              to other Katoen Natie facilities and integration with emerging IoT
              sensors and automation technologies. Moving forward, the
              platform's foundation supports advanced analytics, predictive
              maintenance capabilities, and integration with broader supply
              chain management systems.
            </p>
            <h4>Future Opportunities:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                AI-powered optimization for railcar scheduling and resource
                allocation.
              </li>
              <li>Enhanced sensor integration for automated status updates.</li>
              <li>
                Expansion to other industrial logistics operations within Katoen
                Natie's portfolio.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integration with broader supply chain visibility platforms.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This project demonstrated that thoughtful digital transformation
              in industrial settings requires balancing technological capability
              with operational reality, safety requirements, and the human
              factors that make complex operations successful. The resulting
              platform not only automated existing processes but enabled new
              levels of operational intelligence and safety that weren't
              possible with manual systems.
