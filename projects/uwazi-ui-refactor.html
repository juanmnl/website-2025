          <p class="project-intro">
            Led a comprehensive redesign of a complex human rights documentation
            platform, transforming inconsistent features and fragmented user
            flows into a cohesive, modern interface. Established design
            patterns, improved navigation architecture, and implemented
            user-friendly interactions across dozens of features, resulting in a
            unified experience that made complex data management accessible to
            human rights organizations worldwide.

            <p>
              A powerful human rights platform had evolved organically over
              years, resulting in inconsistent user interfaces, conflicting
              interaction patterns, and fragmented workflows that hindered user
              adoption and efficiency across different features.

            <h3>My Process & Research</h3>
            <p>
              This redesign didn't come out of the blue, after many months of
              fixing details and improving interactions, the team decided it was
              time for a complete remake of the interface. After some
              brainstorming sessions, we agreed that the best approach was to
              start from scratch the UI, with incremental implementation, and
              build a new design system that would unify the user experience
              across the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              I initiated the project by conducting a comprehensive audit of the
              existing interface, identifying inconsistencies in design
              patterns, interaction flows, and user feedback. Concurrently, I
              analyzed what other databases and documentation systems were doing
              to identify best practices.

            <h3>Ideation & Design</h3>
            <p>
              Based manly on research and best practices, I led a series of
              sessions to generate alignment and agreements with the team. We
              focused on simplifying as much as possible the steps to take,
              breaking down complex workflows into clear, actionable stages.
              This allowed us to progress with confidence, reducing cognitive
              load and minimizing errors.
            </p>
            <p>Key design decisions and constraints included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Translate the current features 1:1 while hunting as many bugs as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>Improve the interaction between key worklfows.</li>
              <li>Unify and reuse components.</li>
              <li>
                Generate a design system that would allow us to scale the UI and
                add features without breaking the consistency.
              </li>

              We conducted unmoderated usability tests with 15 participants
              using a clickable Figma prototype. Key findings led to iterative
              improvements, such as refining microcopy and adjusting the
              placement of critical information.

              The new onboarding flow significantly improved user activation. We

              <strong>25% increase in successful account setups</strong> within
              the first month post-launch, exceeding our initial goal.
              Qualitative feedback indicated users found the process much more
              intuitive and less intimidating.

            <p>
              This project reinforced the importance of continuous user
              feedback. We learned that even small changes in microcopy can have
              a significant impact on user understanding. Future iterations
              would involve A/B testing different call-to-action button styles.
