              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                Uwazi had grown organically over several years into a powerful
                human rights documentation platform, but this evolution came at
                a cost. What started as focused solutions for specific needs had
                accumulated into a patchwork of inconsistent user interfaces,
                conflicting interaction patterns, and fragmented workflows.
                Users faced different navigation paradigms across features,
                inconsistent visual hierarchies, and unpredictable interactions
                that forced them to relearn the interface with each new section.
              </p>

              <p>
                This inconsistency created significant barriers to user
                adoption, particularly for new organizations trying to onboard
                their teams. Experienced users found themselves constantly
                context-switching between different interface paradigms,
                reducing their efficiency and increasing cognitive load when
                they needed to focus on critical human rights documentation
                work. The fragmented experience was ultimately hindering the
                platform's mission of empowering human rights organizations with
                accessible, powerful tools.

              <h3>Process & Research</h3>
              <p>
                This redesign emerged from necessity. After months of fixing
                details and improving individual interactions, the team
                recognized it was time for a complete interface overhaul.
                Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, we agreed on a
                comprehensive approach: rebuild the UI from scratch with
                incremental implementation while establishing a unified design
                system across the entire platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                I initiated the project with a thorough audit of the existing
                interface, cataloging inconsistencies in design patterns,
                interaction flows, and gathering user feedback. Simultaneously,
                I researched how other database and documentation systems
                approached similar challenges to identify industry best
                practices.
              </p>

                <li>
                  <strong>User feedback:</strong> Revealed the gap between user
                  expectations and current reality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> Identified best-in-class
                  usability patterns across similar platforms.

                  paths and pain points.

                <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> We lacked proper handover
                documentation from the previous designer, requiring me to
                recreate all implemented UI screens, features, and states in
                Figma before moving forward.

              <h3>Ideation & Design</h3>
              <p>
                Grounded in research insights and industry best practices, I
                facilitated alignment sessions with the team to establish our
                design principles. Our focus was aggressive
                simplificationâ€”breaking complex workflows into clear, actionable
                stages to reduce cognitive load and minimize user errors.
              </p>
              <h4>Core Design Constraints:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Translate existing features 1:1 while eliminating as many bugs
                  as possible.
                </li>
                <li>Improve interactions between key workflows.</li>
                <li>Unify and standardize reusable components.</li>
                <li>

                  additions.

              </ul>

              <p>
                The design system introduced several key components including a
                new table-based UI for consistency, drawer interfaces for
                focused tasks, stepped modals for complex processes, and a
                Dynamic Action Bar (DAB) that surfaces contextual actions based
                on user interactions.

                Our approach emphasized continuous refinement based on
                real-world usage patterns rather than formal testing protocols.
                Through iterative releases, we adjusted interface elements and
                workflows to better align with how human rights organizations
                actually manage complex documentation. Each iteration built upon
                previous improvements, allowing us to fine-tune the experience
                while maintaining system stability for organizations depending
                on the platform daily.

              <p>
                The redesign introduced intuitive navigation, streamlined
                workflows, and modern interface elements that significantly
                reduced cognitive load for users managing complex data and
                documentation. By standardizing components and creating
                predictable user flows, the new interface dramatically improved
                onboarding for new organizations while increasing efficiency for
                existing users. The modernized platform enabled human rights
                organizations to focus on their critical work rather than
                wrestling with inconsistent tools.

              <h3>Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
              <p>
                This project reinforced the importance of gradual, user-centered
                transformation when redesigning complex systems that
                organizations depend on daily. I learned that achieving design
                consistency across dozens of features requires careful
                prioritization and constant user feedback to avoid disrupting
                established workflows.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moving forward, the design system foundation we built enables
                rapid iteration on new features while maintaining the cohesive
                experience users now expect. The new interface structure allows
                us to add features without the complexity of redesigning
                inconsistent patterns each timeâ€”a foundation that will serve the
                platform's evolution for years to come.

                effort. Beyond the implemented features shown here, extensive
                conceptual design work explored new usability patterns and
                interaction paradigms that would further enhance the platform's
                accessibility and power. These explorations laid the groundwork
                for future innovations while ensuring the design system could
                accommodate evolving user needs and emerging technologies in the
                human rights documentation space.
