            Led a comprehensive redesign of a complex human rights documentation
            platform, transforming inconsistent features and fragmented user
            flows into a cohesive, modern interface. Established design
            patterns, improved navigation architecture, and implemented
            user-friendly interactions across dozens of features, resulting in a
            unified experience that made complex data management accessible to

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Uwazi had grown organically over several years into a powerful
              human rights documentation platform, but this evolution came at a
              cost. What started as focused solutions for specific needs had
              accumulated into a patchwork of inconsistent user interfaces,
              conflicting interaction patterns, and fragmented workflows. Users
              faced different navigation paradigms across features, inconsistent
              visual hierarchies, and unpredictable interactions that forced
              them to relearn the interface with each new section.
            </p>

            <p>
              This inconsistency created significant barriers to user adoption,
              particularly for new organizations trying to onboard their teams.
              Experienced users found themselves constantly context-switching
              between different interface paradigms, reducing their efficiency
              and increasing cognitive load when they needed to focus on
              critical human rights documentation work. The fragmented
              experience was ultimately hindering the platform's mission of
              empowering human rights organizations with accessible, powerful
              tools.

            <h3>Process & Research</h3>
            <p>
              This redesign emerged from necessity. After months of fixing
              details and improving individual interactions, the team recognized
              it was time for a complete interface overhaul. Through
              collaborative brainstorming sessions, we agreed on a comprehensive
              approach: rebuild the UI from scratch with incremental
              implementation while establishing a unified design system across
              the entire platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              I initiated the project with a thorough audit of the existing
              interface, cataloging inconsistencies in design patterns,
              interaction flows, and gathering user feedback. Simultaneously, I
              researched how other database and documentation systems approached
              similar challenges to identify industry best practices.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>User feedback:</strong> Revealed the gap between user
                expectations and current reality.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> Identified best-in-class
                usability patterns across similar platforms.

                paths and pain points.

              <li>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> We lacked proper handover
              documentation from the previous designer, requiring me to recreate

              moving forward.

            <h3>Ideation & Design</h3>
            <p>
              Grounded in research insights and industry best practices, I
              facilitated alignment sessions with the team to establish our
              design principles. Our focus was aggressive
              simplificationâ€”breaking complex workflows into clear, actionable
              stages to reduce cognitive load and minimize user errors.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Core Design Constraints:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Translate existing features 1:1 while eliminating as many bugs
                as possible.
              </li>
              <li>Improve interactions between key workflows.</li>
              <li>Unify and standardize reusable components.</li>
              <li>
                Build a scalable design system for consistent future feature
                additions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The design system introduced several key components including a
              new table-based UI for consistency, drawer interfaces for focused
              tasks, stepped modals for complex processes, and a Dynamic Action
              Bar (DAB) that surfaces contextual actions based on user
              interactions.

            <p>
              Our approach emphasized continuous refinement based on real-world
              usage patterns rather than formal testing protocols. Through
              iterative releases, we adjusted interface elements and workflows
              to better align with how human rights organizations actually
              manage complex documentation. Each iteration built upon previous
              improvements, allowing us to fine-tune the experience while
              maintaining system stability for organizations depending on the
              platform daily.

            <h3>The Solution & Impact</h3>
            <p>
              The redesign introduced intuitive navigation, streamlined
              workflows, and modern interface elements that significantly
              reduced cognitive load for users managing complex data and
              documentation. By standardizing components and creating
              predictable user flows, the new interface dramatically improved
              onboarding for new organizations while increasing efficiency for
              existing users. The modernized platform enabled human rights
              organizations to focus on their critical work rather than
              wrestling with inconsistent tools.

            <h3>Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
              This project reinforced the importance of gradual, user-centered
              transformation when redesigning complex systems that organizations
              depend on daily. I learned that achieving design consistency
              across dozens of features requires careful prioritization and
              constant user feedback to avoid disrupting established workflows.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moving forward, the design system foundation we built enables
              rapid iteration on new features while maintaining the cohesive
              experience users now expect. The new interface structure allows us
              to add features without the complexity of redesigning inconsistent
              patterns each timeâ€”a foundation that will serve the platform's
              evolution for years to come.

              This represents just a fraction of the comprehensive redesign
              effort. Beyond the implemented features shown here, extensive
              conceptual design work explored new usability patterns and
              interaction paradigms that would further enhance the platform's
              accessibility and power. These explorations laid the groundwork
              for future innovations while ensuring the design system could
              accommodate evolving user needs and emerging technologies in the
              human rights documentation space.
