          <h1>Preserve: Evidence Collection for the Web</h1>
          <p class="project-intro">
            Designed a browser extension integrated with Uwazi that captures
            tamper-proof evidence from web content, social media posts, and
            online articles for legal proceedings. Solved the unique UX
            challenge of creating seamless evidence collection workflows within
            browser constraints, ensuring captured content maintains legal
            integrity while remaining user-friendly for human rights
            investigators and legal professionals.

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Legal professionals and human rights investigators needed a
              reliable way to capture online evidence that would be admissible
              in court, with seamless integration into their existing Uwazi
              documentation workflows. Traditional screenshot methods and manual
              documentation lacked the cryptographic verification required for
              legal proceedings, while existing tools were either too technical
              for non-technical users or failed to provide the tamper-proof
              guarantees that legal contexts demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge was designing an evidence collection workflow that
              operated seamlessly within browser environments while maintaining
              direct integration with Uwazi's documentation platform. Users
              needed to capture not just visual content, but also metadata,
              timestamps, and source verificationâ€”all while working within the
              constraints of browser extension architecture and ensuring
              captured evidence automatically synced with their ongoing human
              rights cases.

            <h3>Process & Research</h3>
            <p>
              We worked closely with legal experts and human rights
              investigators to understand the specific requirements for
              admissible digital evidence. This involved studying legal
              precedents, understanding chain-of-custody requirements, and
              identifying the most common types of online content that require
              preservation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Studied evidence
                admissibility standards and tamper-proof verification needs.

              The extension design prioritized simplicity and reliability,
              enabling users to capture evidence with minimal technical
              knowledge while ensuring maximum legal integrity. The interface
              focused on clear visual feedback and straightforward interactions
              that work consistently across different websites and content
              types.

            <h3>The Solution & Impact</h3>
            <p>
              This project demonstrated the importance of designing for
              specialized, high-stakes use cases where user experience must
              balance simplicity with technical precision. Working within
              browser extension constraints while meeting legal requirements
              provided unique insights into designing for regulated industries
              and mission-critical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              The alpha validation confirmed that thoughtful UX design can make
              complex legal-technical requirements accessible to non-technical
              users, opening new possibilities for digital evidence collection
              in human rights work and legal proceedings.

            <h3>Current Status & Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
              The alpha version successfully validates the core concept and
              technical feasibility of tamper-proof evidence collection within
              browser environments. User feedback from legal professionals and
              investigators has been positive, confirming the product-market fit
              and identifying key areas for enhancement.

              <li>
                Enhanced user interface with improved visual hierarchy and
                clearer workflows
              </li>
              <li>
                Capture status indicators to provide clear feedback when
                evidence collection fails or encounters issues

              <li>
                Integration capabilities with legal case management systems
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved export options for various legal documentation formats
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The v1 release will transform Preserve from a proof-of-concept
              tool into a production-ready platform that legal professionals can
              confidently integrate into their evidence collection workflows.
